# Smart-Arosa
Connecting the physical space with the information space

## The situation
Today's tourists arent tourists they a webizens pilgrimaging and exploring the physical world.

## Technological landscape
The Web is evolving from a web of documents to a web of data capable of giving in depth information based on individual interests, preferences and background. Geo-location and broadband are available almost erverywehre but inside buildings and with limited roaming capabilities alternatives to geo-fencing and online access are a big plus, that's why our [demo app](https://github.com/smart-arosa/tourismo) pre-fetches a subgraph of the data and use Bluetooth Beacons to locate places.

Bluetooth Low Energy Beacon Technology can be used to /annotate/ they physical space and link it to the Web of Data. Smart Arosa Provide Tourist Information with the help of Beacon Technology. Beacons are small devices, which when nearby with a smartphone, provide Tourist Info with the help of Wifi Technology.
